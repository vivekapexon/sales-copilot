      "content": "## **Why Content Recommendations Are Not Available**\n\nBased on my analysis of the available database tables, here are the reasons why content recommendations weren't available:\n\n### **1. NO DEDICATED CONTENT TABLE**\nThe database contains these tables:\n- `history_mart` - Interaction history\n- `healthcare_data` - HCP profiles and metrics  \n- `formulary_mart` - Access/coverage data\n- `call_action_items` - Follow-up tasks\n- `followup_events` - Scheduled activities\n\n**Missing:** No `content_recommendations` or `approved_materials` table exists.\n\n### **2. LIMITED CONTENT-RELATED FIELDS**\nThe available content-related data points are minimal:\n\n| Table | Field | Current Value for HCP1001 |\n|-------|-------|---------------------------|\n| `healthcare_data` | `content_click_rate_60d` | 20.46% (shows engagement) |\n| `history_mart` | `materials_shared` | \"None\" (no materials shared in recent interaction) |\n\n### **3. WHAT'S MISSING FOR CONTENT RECOMMENDATIONS**\nTo provide proper content recommendations, the system would need:\n\n- **Approved Materials Database** - PDFs, slides, videos, references\n- **Content Performance Data** - What works best for similar HCPs\n- **Clinical Preference Mapping** - Content aligned to HCP interests\n- **Regulatory Compliance** - MLR-approved materials only\n- **Personalization Rules** - Content based on specialty, adoption stage, etc.\n\n### **4. WORKAROUND RECOMMENDATIONS**\nBased on available data, I can suggest content strategy using:\n\n**HCP Profile Context:**\n- **Specialty:** Medical Oncology → Clinical efficacy data\n- **Adoption Stage:** 5 (Advanced) → Advanced clinical evidence\n- **Content Click Rate:** 20.46% → Prefers digital content\n- **KOL Video Engagement:** Previously clicked → Responds to video content\n\n**Recommended Content Types:**\n- Advanced clinical data for experienced oncologists\n- Digital/video formats (based on engagement patterns)\n- Efficacy-focused materials (to address competitive pressure)\n- Access support tools (for PA requirements)\n\nThe content recommendation gap indicates a need for a dedicated content management system integrated with the CRM data.\n"

For full content recommendations, you would need access to:\n- MLR-approved materials database\n- Content performance analytics\n- Personalized content mapping\n\nThe available content focuses on clinical safety and interaction profiles, which aligns with the oncology specialty requirements.\n"

I'm glad I could help clarify the content recommendation situation for HCP1001. \n\nTo summarize what we discovered:\n- The system doesn't have a dedicated Content Agent as originally expected\n- However, we did find some content-related information in the follow-up events\n- The available content focuses on drug-drug interaction profiles and safety information\n- This actually aligns well with Dr. Campbell's medical oncology specialty and advanced adoption stage\n\nIf you need any further analysis on HCP1001 or have questions about other HCPs, feel free to ask!\n"
